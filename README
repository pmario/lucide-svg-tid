This plugin provides an alternative TiddlyWiki icons set using the [[Lucide icons|https://lucide.dev/]] as a basis.

- To get it going you need to clone the lucide-repo along with this repository
- You need to install all the dependencies in the lucide-repo
- Then you need to run `pnpm --filter outline-svg start` to build the lucide outlined icons
- Then "link" the "outlined" directory from lucide to the "outlined" directory here into this repo. The scripts expect it that way. 
- Then run the local scripts
